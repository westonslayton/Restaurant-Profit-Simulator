# Restaurant-Profit-Simulator

We are given the following scenarios to analyze for restaurant optimization:

Scenario 1: Consider the simple setting with one dining table and one chef, with operating hours 10am - 10pm. Suppose customers arrive according to a Poisson process with a rate of 位A = 5 per hour. Once a customer arrives, their total service time (ordering, cooking and eating) can be modeled by an exponential distribution with rate 位S = 6.

Note: It is reasonable to assume waiting and service times for each customer are independently distributed. If a customer arrives and the dining table is occupied, then they would wait in line until the table is vacant.


Scenario 2: Consider the setting with 5 dining tables and L chefs, with operating hours 10am - 10pm. Suppose customers arrive according to a Poisson process with a rate of 位A = 10 per hour. Once a customer arrives, their total service time can be modeled by an exponential distribution with rate 位S = 3L. Assume a customer spends $50 per meal, and each chef earns a wage of $40 per hour.
