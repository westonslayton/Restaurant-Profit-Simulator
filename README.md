# Restaurant-Profit-Simulator

We are given the following scenarios to analyze for restaurant optimization:

Scenario 1: Consider the simple setting with one dining table and one chef, with operating hours 10am - 10pm. Suppose customers arrive according to a Poisson process with a rate of λA = 5 per hour. Once a customer arrives, their total service time (ordering, cooking and eating) can be modeled by an exponential distribution with rate λS = 6.

Note: It is reasonable to assume waiting and service times for each customer are independently distributed. If a customer arrives and the dining table is occupied, then they would wait in line until the table is vacant.

Question: Comment on the customer’s queueing experience in this setting.

Scenario 2: Consider the setting with 5 dining tables and L chefs, with operating hours 10am - 10pm. Suppose customers arrive according to a Poisson process with a rate of λA = 10 per hour. Once a customer arrives, their total service time can be modeled by an exponential distribution with rate λS = 3L. Assume a customer spends $50 per meal, and each chef earns a wage of $40 per hour.

Questions: Comment on the customer’s queueing experience in this setting, particularly we vary the number of chefs L. From a business perspective, how many chefs L should be hired to maximize profits with high probability? Justify your recommendation. Comment on the down-time of the restaurant throughout the day, and what this might means for business operation.
